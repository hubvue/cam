#### Init
The configuration file needs to be initialised before the `camer` can be used. This is done by executing `camer init`.

```bash
$ camer init
[CAM INFO]: cam initialization succeeded, please run `source /Users/kim/.zshrc`
```
When the above message is output on the command line, the initialisation is successful.

#### Ls

  ga   |            git add

  gaa  |           git add -A

  ni   |          npm install
-------+--------------------------------
  ya   |            yarn add

  pa   |            pnpm add

-------+--------------------------------
   d   |          npm run dev
-------+--------------------------------
   b   |         npm run build
```
These are the default alias settings.

#### Add
The `camer add` command adds a new alias. The alias name and the command to be executed are required.

Let's add an alias for the `npm run deploy` command
```bash
$ camer add nd "npm run deploy"
[CAM INFO]: nd added successfully, please run `source /Users/kim/.zshrc`
```
The above result means that this was added successfully, so let's run the prompt command to make it work.

#### Remove
The `camer remove` command removes an existing alias. The alias name is required.

Let's remove the alias added in Add
```bash
$ camer remove nd
[CAM INFO]: remove nd alias succeeded, please run `source /Users/kim/.zshrc`
```
The above result means that this was removed successfully, so let's run the prompt command to make it work.

#### Clean
When you want to uninstall the camer application, please run `camer clean` before downloading if you need the configuration file to be removed along with it.

```bash
$ camer clean
[CAM Info]: Cam cleanup succeeded
```
The above result means that the cleanup was successful.

If you want to continue using it, please run `camer init` again to initialise it.
